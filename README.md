# CalcLyst_Compiler
We have finished the ast and scanner files based on our design and completed a simple
version of parser with small test files to demonstrate how the language looks like.

Work left:
develope CalcLyst with more complex tests and update ast, parser, and scanner to make it
successfully compile.

expected timeline:
add most build-in function by 4/14

finish CalcLyst by 4/20
